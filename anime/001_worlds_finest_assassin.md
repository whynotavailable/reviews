# The World's Finest Assassin Gets Reincarnated in Another World as an Aristocrat

**First three episodes review**

Based on a light novel of the same name, the story follows Lugh Tuatha Dé, a legendary assassin reborn into a fantasy world in order to kill the "hero". It adheres to some of the worst tropes in storytelling, though the "How We Got Here" (https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowWeGotHere) trope isn't too terrible of an idea. They also use Lugh (though it wasn't his name at the time) doing his last mission with a novice as a way to introduce the world to the viewers. That they do worse than fridging the girl by not only killing her when she's not yet able to do anything but then completely ignoring her existence and not using her for any plot movement whatsoever.

The trope of the isekei (other world story) has been very popular recently, and this one dives right in. The themes of a power fantasy in another world where your advanced knowledge is very useful and you are able to get cute girls to like you by doing absolutely nothing is all here. How this mirrors the otaku experience of a feeling of powerlessness and revulsion by women explains the popularity of the trope. They try however to prove it isn’t a power fantasy through the ultra powerful entity that is the hero.

They make a point, extensively, about how powerful the hero is compared to Lugh. This is undermined by Lugh not actually needing to kill the hero. He only needs to save the world, and according to the goddess the easier way is to just kill the hero. This is a Chekhov's gun. Especially given the lesson from the father that killing isn’t done just to follow orders, but only when that’s the best way to benefit the country (and by extension the world). Through this logic it means that since the hero isn’t a threat, they aren’t a balance to Lugh making it blatantly just another power fantasy.

I would be remiss if I didn’t mention the idiosyncrasies of a 7 year old performing the physical and mental feats Lugh performs, but since age is generally meaningless in anime I tend to let it slide. My bigger issue is with the behavior of a noble house without any servants as well as performing a hunt for a rabbit of all things, but that as well is simply a method to show off how cool and awesome the main character is to the detriment of a cohesive world.

The worst of it however is the “fan service”. I cannot see this as anything but a vessel to deliver images of a naked young boy to viewers. The absolute degeneracy of the examination scene by itself means I am unable to recommend this to anyone I like. I will also never understand the idea in anime of taking someone, and dressing them up like a cute girl for a laugh. Especially to young boys this is not ideal in many ways. So as the latin would say caveat emptor.

As far as the supporting cast goes you have the parents who might as well be cardboard and Dia Viekone, Lugh’s mentor in magic. She, as per the common trope is the young (12) girl who is the absurdly powerful mage that mentors the main character and falls in love with him. She as well is cardboard but the tropes are strong with her so she’ll likely get into some trouble with a fiance the main character needs to solve in the future.

This show is a disaster. Even if there was something redeemable I wouldn’t be able to due to how degenerate it is.

Rating: No
